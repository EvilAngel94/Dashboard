# Dashboard
The goal of the dashboard is to have all the possible tools I often use in one place. 
This will mainly be a web application. This will also function as a learning tool while programming this. 

The application as mentioned before, will be at the beginning mainly focussed on personal use. 
It will become an application which can be started from localhost (specific port).
