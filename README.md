# Dashboard
The project is created to have all the useful development tools and miscellaneous tools on one page. 
These are mainly a small text editor to take notes in. Some useful links to other websites which I use often during work.

At this moment in time, these tools are only redirecting, or showing basic information on the dashboard. 
Furthermore, the application will also only be usabel locally (on localhost somewhere). This will be further explained once this is implemented.
